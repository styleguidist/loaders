// Note: This list needs to be updated with every change of extensions the other loaders match.
// E.g., when adding a loader for a new supported file extension, we need to add the supported extension to this loader too.
// Add one new line in `exclude` for each loader.
//
// "file" loader makes sure those assets get served by WebpackDevServer.
// When you `import` an asset, you get its (virtual) filename.

// smaller than specified limit in bytes as data URLs to avoid requests.
// A missing `test` is equivalent to a match.
